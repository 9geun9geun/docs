# Kumu.io and Kumu Enterprise

On [our pricing page](https://kumu.io/pricing), we offer two products: Kumu.io and Kumu Enterprise.

**Kumu.io** is the online versionâ€”you can [sign up at any time online](https://kumu.io/join) for a free account. **Kumu Enterprise** has the same software and features as Kumu.io under the hood, but you can host it separately from all the people using Kumu.io.


## Which product is right for me?
  
Kumu Enterprise is the right choice for teams that are working with highly sensitive data that should only be accessed through private, isolated servers, and not through our website, https://kumu.io. Enterprise versions are also a great option for teams that are legally required to store their data in a specific geographic location (https://kumu.io stores data across the world).

To get started with Kumu Enterprise and learn more about its security features, please email us at [enterprise@kumu.io](mailto:enterprise@kumu.io).

If you need help with installing, configuring, or upgrading your Enterprise version, [see our full Enterprise guides](/enterprise/).

For anyone who doesn't have high security needs
