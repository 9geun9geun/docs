# Accounts and plans

There are two types of Kumu accounts that you can own: **personal** accounts and **organization** accounts. You can also get the **enterprise** version of Kumu, which is not just an account or plan—rather, it's a fully separate installation of Kumu on your own private servers.

This guide will explain the differences between these three options—if you're not sure which is the right choice for you, you're in the right place!


## Personal accounts

Personal accounts are a great fit for individuals working on their own projects, [collaborating](/overview/collaboration.md#add-a-contributor) with a few other people, or being invited to collaborate on someone else's project. Personal accounts are also a good option for teams of people that only have one designated Kumu expert, who builds and manages all of the Kumu projects for the team.

Anyone can [sign up for a free personal account](https://kumu.io/join) to create and own unlimited public projects—we love it when you share your work! Private projects are a paid service, and we've listed the pricing options in the table below. After you sign up for your free account, you can go to your [account settings](https://kumu.io/settings) to select a paid plan.

Not sure which type of project you need? [Check out our guide on collaborating and sharing](/overview/collaboration.md#public-vs-private-projects) to learn the key differences between public and private projects.

<b>Note:</b> You need to create a personal account (either free or paid) in order to create and own an organization account. Even if you think an organization account is the right option for you, be sure to <a class="alert-link" href="https://kumu.io/join">sign up for your personal account</a> first.

## Organization accounts

Kumu's organization accounts are a great fit for teams of people that have several active Kumu users. Organization accounts are also really useful when you're creating Kumu projects for clients, and you'd like your clients to be able to check in on your progress and give feedback.

When you own an organization account, you can add other people to your organization (or invite your team via email) and assign one of three roles to those people:
- **Owners** can add new members, and they have full access to everything within the organization. The creator of the organization account is an Owner by default. Owners also have admin access to update billing and profile information.
- **Members** can see a list of all projects owned by the organization, but can only open projects they've been given access to.
- **Guests** can only see and access the projects and teams they've explicitly been given access to.

After you add people to your organization, you'll be able to specify which projects each person can access, and whether they can view, edit, or have admin access on those projects. For more details on how to fine-tune project access, check out our [full guide on organizations](/guides/organizations.md).

As an added bonus, you can upload your own logo to appear on your projects' loading screen and as a watermark on [shared & embedded maps](/overview/collaboration.md#create-a-shareembed-link).

Just like personal accounts, organization accounts can be created for free, and can own unlimited public projects. Private projects are a paid service, and we've listed the pricing options in the table below.

## Enterprise version

The Enterprise version of Kumu is the right choice for teams that are working with highly sensitive data that should only be accessed through private servers, rather than through Kumu's cloud-based system. Enterprise versions are also a great option for teams that are legally required to store their data in a specific geographic location (Kumu's cloud-based system stores data across the world).

Note that the Enterprise version is not an account or plan, rather, it's a fully separate installation of Kumu. When you have an Enterprise version installed on your servers, you can create unlimited personal and organization accounts within that version, and each account can own unlimited private and public projects.

Enterprise licensing starts at $79/user/month, billed annually, with a minimum of 5 seats—in other words, Enterprise starts at $4,740 annually. Additional seats can be purchased in packs of 5.

To get started with a 45-day free trial of Enterprise, [fill our our short inquiry form](https://kumu.io/enterprise/purchase). If you need with installing, configuring, or upgrading your Enterprise version, [check out our full Enterprise guides](/enterprise/).
