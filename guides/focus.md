# Focus

Focus is activated in one of two ways, by clicking and holding on any element or connection or by clicking the focus button in the bottom toolbar. Once activated, you can walk in and out by degree using the "+" and "-" keys on your keyboard (don't hold shift, just hit the key).

If you click the focus button in the toolbar, you'll be prompted with a menu of how many degrees out you'd like to focus. Once focus is activated, you can click and hold on any element to bring that element's direct connections into view.
