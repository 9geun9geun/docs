# Views

A view is a collection of decorations, filters, and other settings that change what is visible on your map and how it is styled. You can create any number of views, and a view can apply to multiple maps (a map just defines the elements and connections that should be part of a map and their position).

## Creating a new view
Use the navigation at the top of your map and click the view dropdown menu on the right. Click "+ new view" and give the view a name.

## Switching views
Switch between views using the navigation at the top of your map.

## Editing a view
To edit a view, first select the view in the dropdown at the top of your map and then click the settings button (<i class="fa fa-sliders"></i>) on the right side of the map. Use the links below to access guides for each of the tabs in the view:

* [Filter](/guides/filter.html)
* [Cluster](/guides/clustering.html)
* [Decorate](/guides/decorate.html)
* [Settings](/overview/settings.html#view-settings)

## Renaming, duplicating, or deleting a view
If you want to rename or delete a view, first select the view in the dropdown at the top of your map. Then click the settings button to open the sidebar and then click the more menu (...) in the upper right corner. You can then choose to:

* Rename view
* Duplicate view
* Delete view
