# Snap To

The Snap To feature makes it easy to move a group of elements into a circle or into a line. This can be helpful in quickly positioning elements in your map in a line or a circle, while also enabling you to do analysis based on grouped or sorted elements positioned quickly. You can group or sort the elements in the line or circle based on field data stored in their profile. Select an element or group of element, then right click and choose "Snap to line" or "Snap to circle".
