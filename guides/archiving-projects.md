# Archiving projects

Archiving projects—an exclusive feature for [organization accounts](/guides/organizations.html)—is a great way to reduce your private project expenses _without_ deleting projects or making them public.

An archived private project will stay private, and you can view the project, its [presentations](/guides/presentations.html), and its [shared/embedded versions](/guides/share-and-embed.html) at any time. Archived projects don't incur monthly charges, and if you archive in the middle of a billing period, your next charge will be pro-rated.

Note, however, that you won't be able to edit the archived project, create new presentations or shared/embedded versions of it, or leave comments, unless you **unarchive** the project first.

To unarchive a project, send an email to [support@kumu.io](mailto:support@kumu.io) with a link to the project, and our team will take the next steps. A $20 unarchiving fee will be billed to the account owner when we unarchive the project, and we are typically able to respond to unarchive requests within 24 hours.

To archive one of your projects: open the project, then click the menu icon <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> in the upper left corner to open the [project settings](/overview/settings.html#project-settings). Select **Admin**, and click **Archive project**.
