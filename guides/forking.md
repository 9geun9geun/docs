# Forking

A fork is a copy of a project. Forking a project allows you to experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Forks are commonly used to propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own.

## Creating a fork
Forking is currently available for **public projects only**.

To fork a public project, click the share menu in the upper right corner of the map and then click the fork icon (<i class="fa fa-code-fork"></i>). This will:

* Create a copy ("fork") of the entire project, including all perspectives, maps and presentations
* The fork will be created under your personal account with the same name as the original project
* Only you will have access initially to the fork (but you can add other collaborators as needed)
* All presentations in the fork revert to unpublished (even if they were published in the original)
* Any links in the project will remain the same (so make sure to use relative links to have a fork-friendly project)

## Intellectual property and forking
By using a public project on Kumu, you [agree](https://kumu.io/terms) to let other users fork your project. This does not grant any intellectual property rights so it is important for anyone using the fork function to ensure that they are not violating the rights of others. We'll be adding support for including a license on your project to make it clear which rights you are willing to grant to others. It's our hope that people contribute generously to the community by choosing to use the [Kokua License](https://medium.com/@rymohr/the-kokua-license-b2f430a03f4a#.razdhigjg), but the exact license will be up to each project owner to decide.

## The future of forking
The ability to create a copy of a project is just the first step towards a more robust collaboration model. In the future, you'll be able to propose changes back to the original project owner based on work completed in your fork (hence why we've used the term "fork" instead of copy, duplicate, clone, etc.). You'll also gain more visibility into who has forked a given project.
