# Filter

Filters make it easy to show and hide elements, connections or loops based on data stored in the profile. Click the Settings icon <i class="fa fa-sliders"></i> on the right side of the map, then click the icon to the right of **Filter** to open up your filter settings.

If you're filtering by element or connection type, simply un-check the types you want to hide. To filter using other fields, use the "also include" and "but ignore" fields. Click the rocket icon <i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> to the right of the input of each field to select what you want to hide or make visible.

If you've hidden certain elements and connections using the type checkboxes, you can use the **Also include** tool to bring things back into view. But, you first have to un-check some of the boxes above, or this tool will have no effect.


Use the **But ignore** tool to hide elements and connections from your map. Anything you add here will override the settings in the checkboxes above and the **Also include** tool.
