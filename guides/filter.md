# Filter

Filters can be added on the fly (meaning they aren't saved to the perspective) or saved to the perspective. Click the filter button in the bottom toolbar or click the filter tab within perspectives.

If you're filtering by element or connection type, simply uncheck the types you want to filter and then click update (or update and save to save to the current perspective). To filter using other attributes, click more options and you'll see two fields: include and ignore. Click the rocket icon (<i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>) on the right side of the input to build out the selector which defines what you want to include or ignore.

* **Include** For include to work properly, first uncheck the types. Remember that include adds things back to the map so if everything is already there, this field has no effect.
* **Ignore** This field works as a blacklist to remove elements and connections from your map.
