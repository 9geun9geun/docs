## Common Questions

**Is it possible to import data?**
We have an easy to use [import format](/guides/import.md) that lets you import either xlsx or csv files. Comfortable with JSON? Use our blueprint format for even more power and control.

**Why won't my map stop moving? OR Why are certain elements fixed in place?**
Elements in Kumu can be either fixed or floating. You can set the default behavior in the settings menu (click <i class="fa fa-sliders fa-rotate-270"></i> on the right side of your map). If you'd like to pin all elements (or unpin all of them), hit "a" to select all and then use the pin button in the bottom right of the selection profile.

**Can I collaborate with others?**<br />
Yep! You can invite people to be able to edit your project. If you're on an organization plan, you have additional flexibility and can add others with view, edit, or admin rights through teams.

**How much does Kumu cost?**<br />
Public project are always free of charge. Personal plans start at $9 per month (for 1 private project) and Organization plans start at $99 per month (for 5 private projects).

**Is a desktop version available?**<br />
No, Kumu is currently only offered as a web-based platform.
