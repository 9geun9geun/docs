# Picking a template

When you create a new project in Kumu, the first thing you'll be prompted to do is pick a template for your first map:

![Template Selection](/images/template-selection.png)

## System template
Use the system template if you are creating a systems map (whether you call that a causal loop diagram, stock and flow diagram, or just a causal map). This template uses default settings to allow you to position your elements by hand.

## Stakeholder template
Use the stakeholder template anytime you are mapping networks that aren't huge (<1000 elements). This template uses our layout algorithm to position elements automatically.

## SNA template
Use the SNA template anytime you are mapping large networks (>1000 elements). This template uses our "fast" mode which draws elements as squares and connections as straight lines to improve performance. This template uses our layout algorithm to position elements automatically.

## Custom template
If you'd like to start out without any custom decorations or settings, choose the custom template. This template uses our layout algorithm to position elements automatically.
