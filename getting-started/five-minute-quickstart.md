### 1. Sign up for an account

Visit https://kumu.io/join to sign up for an account. Accounts come in two flavors, *personal* and *organization*. First create a personal account that represent your personal identity. Once you sign in with your personal account, you can create your first organization by clicking your user avatar in the upper right corner of the dashboard.

### 2. Create your first project

Create a new project from your dashboard and choose whether you want it to be public (anyone can view, you control who can edit) or private (you contol who can view and edit). You'll be prompted to choose a template. Pick the one that seems closest to what you are trying to map. Confused? Start with the stakeholder or custom templates.

### 3. Add your first elements and connections

You can add elements in three basic ways:

- By clicking the "add element" and "add connection" buttons
- Importing an XLSX file by clicking the cloud icon in the lower right corner
- Using keyboard shortcuts (hold alt and click anywhere to add an element, hold alt and click and drag from an element to create a connection)

### 4. Get to know how profiles work for elements and connections

Click on any element or connection to see its profile on the left hand side. Use this profile to add fields that describe what you are mapping. Here are a few fields to spark ideas:

- Phone number
- Email
- Sector
- Level of influence
- Net worth
- Skills

### 5. Create your first decoration

Change the decorations of elements or connections based on profile data using perspectives. You can toggle to perspectives in the upper right corner of the map overview. Once there, you'll see an "add element decoration" button that you can use to change the size and color of an element.

Simply follow the prompts to select what should be decorated, and then choose whether you want to change the color or size.

### 6. Invite a collaborator

If you're working in a personal account, use the menu in the upper left corner to access the "members" section. Type the username of the person you want to add to your project and then click "add contributor".
