# Adding a collaborator

Adding a collaborator to a map works differently depending on whether you are working in a personal or an organization project.

## Adding a collaborator to a personal project

To add a collaborator to a personal project, click the menu in the upper left and then choose "members". From there, type the username of the person you want to add, and then click "add contributor".

## Adding a collaborator to an organization project

Organization projects come with the added benefit of allowing you to add members as either viewers, editors, or admins. To add someone to an organization project, first go to your [dashboard](https://kumu.io/dashboard). From there, use the menu in the upper right corner to switch to your organization. Then click "settings" and then "add member" and choose to add then as either a guest (can only see projects they are granted access to), member (can see names of all projects), or owner (can access every project in the organization).

Once you do that, create a team and add them to the team. From there, the team can be granted access to a project.
