# Basic vs advanced editor

You can edit the view with two different editors, basic and advanced. We recommend starting with basic and then switching to advanced as needed. Certain functionality within Kumu is only available by using the advanced editor.

## Basic editor

Click the settings icon (<i class="fa fa-sliders fa-rotate-90"></i>) on the right side of the map to open the basic editor:

<span class="small plain">
![](/images/introduction-settings.png)
</span>

You'll see tabs for filter, cluster, decorate, and settings.

## Advanced editor

Click "switch to advanced editor" at the bottom of the sidebar to open the advanced editor:

<span class="small plain">
![](/images/advanced-editor-hf.png)
</span>

Everything you change in the basic editor is automatically transferred into raw code in the advanced editor.
