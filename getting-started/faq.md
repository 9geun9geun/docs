# Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I share my maps with others?

Of course! Check out the [sharing](../advanced-guides/sharing.md) guide to learn about embeds and screenshots or [add a collaborator](../advanced-guides/collaboration.md) to your project.

### Do you have high resolution screenshots available? Or a PDF?

We offer a paid service ($9 per PDF) to create a PDF of any map. Just send the link of your map to [prints@kumu.io](mailto:prints@kumu.io).
