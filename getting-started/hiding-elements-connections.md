# Hiding elements and connections

You don't necessarily want all of the elements and connections in your map visible all the time. Filter and focus allow you to show just those elements and connections you want visible.

## Filter
Filters work by showing/hiding elements and connections based on the data in the profiles. Filters can be edited by clicking the settings button on the right side of the map.

If you're filtering by element or connection type, simply uncheck the types you want to hide. To filter using other fields, use the "also include" and "but ignore" fields. Click the rocket icon (<i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>) to the right of the input of each field to build out the selector for what you want to hide or make visible.

* **Also include** If you've hidden certain elements and connections using the type checkboxes, you can use the "also include" field to bring things back into view. **So unless you have some types unchecked, this field will have no effect!**
* **But ignore** Use this field to hide elements and connections from your map. Whatever selector you add here will win out over anything you've set using the checkboxes or the "also include" field.


## Focus
Focus works by showing only the portion of the network within a certain number of connections. Focus is activated in one of two ways, by clicking and holding on any element or connection or by selecting one or more elements, connections or loops and clicking the focus button in the bottom right of the selection profile. Once activated, you can walk in and out by degree using the "+" and "-" keys on your keyboard (don't hold shift, just hit the respective keys) or using the 1-9 numerical keys.

When you click the focus button, you'll be prompted with a menu of how many degrees out you'd like to focus. Once focus is activated, you can click and hold on any element to bring that element's direct connections into view.
