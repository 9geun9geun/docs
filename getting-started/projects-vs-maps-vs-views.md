# Projects vs maps vs views

All of your work in Kumu takes place in a project. A project can have any number of maps and views within it.

## Projects

All of the data is stored at the project level. Think of the project as the overall "bucket" within which any data you add or import is stored.

Access is controlled at the project level, meaning you invite collaborators to a project rather than individual maps.

## Maps

Maps are a collection of elements and connections. They essentially include a subset of the overall project data and specify basic settings:

* Whether elements are positioned manually or automatically
* Whether connections are directed by default
* What the default view is

## Views

Views are a collection of decorations and settings which control what the map looks like and what is visible. Views include filters, focus, decorations, and settings.
