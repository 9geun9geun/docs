# How do I keep elements from moving?

### Temporarily pause element movement

If you'd like to **temporarily** stop moving elements in your map, hit the `spacebar`. Press `spacebar` again and they will go back to floating.

### Permanently pin elements in place

If you'd like to **permanently** stop all elements from moving, you'll want to *pin* elements in place. Do this by pressing `a` to select all elements, then hit the pin icon in the sidebar. This will pin all existing elements in place.

### Default element movement behavior

If you'd like to set the default element movement behavior to "fixed", go to Settings, click on General, and change the "Default element behavior" from `Floating` to `Fixed`.
