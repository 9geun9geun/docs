In the window that opens, choose "admin" and then click "delete project".

## For Organization Projects
You can delete a project through the organization settings page. You can access this by first visiting your dashboard (https://kumu.io/dashboard) and then clicking the "Organizations" tab. From there, click on the "settings" button for your organization and you'll see a list of your projects. Click the project you want to delete, then click the "edit" button in the window that opens, and then you'll see a "delete project" button.
