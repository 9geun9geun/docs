# How do I add images to my elements?

### Building a map by hand

If you are building a map by hand, add a [Field](/guides/fields.md) entitled "Image". Then, add the public URL for the image in the "Image" field for each element.

### Building a map via spreadsheet import

If you are using a [spreadsheet import](/guides/import.md) to create your map, make sure to add an "Image" column in the the "Elements" sheet. In the "Image" column, add the public URL for the image that you want to appear for that element.
