# How do I downgrade my personal account to free?

If you want to downgrade your personal account back to the free plan (which includes unlimited public projects), all you need to do is make sure your account doesn't own any private projects. If you have private projects, you can take one of these three actions:

1. [Convert the private project(s) to public](/faq/how-do-i-convert-a-project-from-private-to-public.html)
1. [Transfer the private project(s) to another user](/faq/how-do-i-transfer-a-project.html)
1. [Delete the private projec(s)](/faq/how-do-i-delete-a-project-map-or-view.html)


If you are being billed monthly, Kumu's billing system will automatically put you on the free plan as soon as you have removed all private projects from your account. If you are being billed annually, please contact support at support@kumu.io so that we can reduce you private project limit to zero.
