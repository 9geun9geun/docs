# How do I get rid of duplicate elements?

If you find _a few duplicates in your map_, it’s best to delete them by hand by selecting the duplicate and clicking the trash icon in the sidebar.

If you’ve found _a lot of duplicates in your map_, try following these steps to remove them:
- Using the [remove duplicates](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Filter-for-unique-values-or-remove-duplicate-values-ccf664b0-81d6-449b-bbe1-8daaec1e83c2) feature in Excel, check to make sure there are no duplicates and then remove them in your spreadsheet.
- In your map, hit `a` to select all elements and connections. Delete them.
- Click on [Project Settings](/overview/settings.html#locations-of-the-various-settings-menus) and then “Trash” to go to the Project Trash.
- Click “Destroy All” to empty the trash and prepare your map for a fresh import.
- Re-import your spreadsheet into your map.

**Note**: We reconcile elements in imports by “label” and by “type.” So, if you change anything in the “label” or “type” columns in your import spreadsheet, a duplicate element will be created. To avoid this, check out [How to avoid duplicates in my map?](how-do-I-avoid-duplicates-in-imports.md).
