# How do I get rid of duplicate elements?

If you find _a few duplicates in your map_, it’s best to delete them by hand by selecting the duplicate and clicking the trash icon in the sidebar.

If you find _lots of duplicates in your map_, try following these steps to remove them:

- Check to see whether you have duplicate labels in your import spreadsheet. We reconcile based on the combination of label AND type for imports (check out this [handy guide](http://blog.kumu.io/5-tips-for-becoming-a-spreadsheet-master/) for detecting duplicates).
- Remove any unwanted duplicates in your spreadsheet.
- In your map, hit `a` to select all elements and connections. Delete them by clicking on the trash icon in the left sidebar.
- Click the menu in the upper left to access the [project settings](/overview/settings.html#locations-of-the-various-settings-menus) and then click on "trash".
- Click “destroy all” to empty the trash and prepare your map for a fresh import.
- Re-import your spreadsheet into your map.
