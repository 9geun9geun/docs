# Who is allowed to edit my project?

You, as the project owner, have full control over who's allowed to edit a project,
regardless of whether the project is public or private.

Although public projects can be accessed by anyone, only members added to the project
by the owner will be able to edit them.

With personal projects, all members of the project are able to edit it.
Please look into our Organization accounts if you want to add members
with read-only access to a private project.
