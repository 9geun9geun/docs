# How do I convert a project to private?

To convert a public project to private, right click on the map, click "Project", then click "Convert project (public/private)".

Alternatively, go to the Project Menu by clicking on the menu icon in the top left corner of the map. From the [Project Settings](/overview/settings.md) popup window, click on Admin. There you will see "Change privacy". You can change the project from public to private there.

***Note:** You will only be able to convert a public project to private if you are a paid subscriber to Kumu. To upgrade your account, go to your [dashboard settings](https://kumu.io/settings#change-plan) to change your plan and add your payment information.
