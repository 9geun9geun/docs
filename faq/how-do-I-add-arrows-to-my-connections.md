# How do I add arrows to my connections?

If you want to add arrows to your connections to specify direction, here are a couple ways to do so:

### For a single connection

* Select the connection.
* Use the "direction" icon in the sidebar menu to specify "Directed", "Mutual", or reverse the connection direction.
* Click "Directed" to add a connection arrow.

### For all connections

* Hit `a` on your keyboard to select all elements and connections.
* Hit `x` next to elements to unselect the elements.
* Click on the "Direction" icon in the sidebar.
* Click "Directed" to add arrows to all connections.

*Note: Kumu recognizes connection direction from your spreadsheet import (from/to columns in your connections sheet) or the direction you draw the connection by hand. This connection direction determines which way arrows point when you specify a "directed" connection.*
