# Perspectives / Style Sheets

Beneath perspectives, Kumu uses a powerful CSS-based language to control the appearance of your maps.

If you're familiar with CSS, the advanced perspective editor will quickly
become your best friend.  The perspective builder only exposes a small set
of the available properties.  Being able to write perspectives by hand is
the only way to harness the full power of Kumu.

**Note:** We've adopted standard CSS properties and values wherever possible, straying where
conventional values were irrelevant or misleading (eg `display: map` vs `display: block`),
and adding properties specific to Kumu (such as `bullseye-color`).

All values are unitless.
